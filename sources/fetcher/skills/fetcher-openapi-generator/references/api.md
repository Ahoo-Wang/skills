## Programmatic API (CodeGenerator)

The published package supports both ESM imports and CommonJS
`const { CodeGenerator } = require('@ahoo-wang/fetcher-generator')`.

`logger` is a required option (`Logger` interface: `info`/`success`/`error`/`progress`/`progressWithCount`). The package does not export a logger implementation — provide your own:

```typescript
import { CodeGenerator } from '@ahoo-wang/fetcher-generator';

const generator = new CodeGenerator({
  inputPath: './openapi.yaml',
  outputDir: './src/generated',
  tsConfigFilePath: './tsconfig.json',
  logger: {
    info: console.info,
    success: console.info,
    error: console.error,
    progress: console.info,
    progressWithCount: (current, total, message) =>
      console.info(`${message} (${current}/${total})`),
  },
});
await generator.generate();
```

Re-running generation with the output included in the supplied tsconfig
rebuilds the generated declarations instead of appending duplicates.
Each successful run records generated files and their content hashes in
`<outputDir>/.fetcher-generator.json`, including barrel indexes. Later runs remove
files no longer generated only when they remain unchanged, then rebuild indexes
without exports for removed output. This also works across generator instances
when the output is not included in tsconfig. Handwritten files, modified stale
files, and legacy output without an ownership record are preserved; keep the
manifest with the generated output to enable cleanup. Only current generated
files are formatted and saved. Rendering failures leave existing output intact,
and retrying the same instance discards drafts from the failed run. Filesystem
save failures can leave partial output; generation is not a directory transaction.

### Key Exports

`CodeGenerator`, `DEFAULT_CONFIG_PATH` (`./fetcher-generator.config.json`) — that is the complete public surface; option and config interfaces (`GeneratorOptions`, `GeneratorConfiguration`) are not re-exported from the package entry.

## Code Generation Pipeline

Component aliases are resolved locally; cyclic component aliases fail generation. When a referenced model shares a name with a declaration or another import in the generated file, the import receives a distinct local alias; repeated references reuse it. The public generated model keeps its original component name. Potential `EnumText` names are reserved before generation, so schema order cannot create an import collision.
Schema aliases retain their target type identity (`type Alias = Target`), including
enum aliases across model files. Response aliases are resolved before selecting
the JSON, text, or event-stream decoder.
Path-level parameters are inherited by operations; an operation overrides a
parameter with the same name and location. API and command clients both resolve
custom component parameter references and aliases before binding path arguments.
Command clients retain `wow.id` and continue to omit `tenantId`/`ownerId` arguments.
JSON string responses are decoded as JSON.

Command identification follows local response aliases only when their chain reaches
`#/components/responses/wow.CommandOk`; matching an unrelated response shape is not
sufficient. Inline and locally referenced command request bodies are supported.
Component lookup stays within the referenced local component category at every
alias hop. External documents are not fetched or substituted with same-named local
components. Unbundled external schema references fail with their URI and bundling
guidance instead of generating a local model name. Unresolved response references keep the raw `Promise<Response>` fallback;
unresolved parameter references do not produce named path arguments. Bundle or
inline external references before generation for complete typed signatures.

```
parseOpenAPI(inputPath) → AggregateResolver(openAPI).resolve()
  → ModelGenerator.generate() → ClientGenerator.generate()
    → Index Generator → Optimize (formatText, organizeImports, fixMissingImports)
```

1. **parseOpenAPI** - Parse JSON/YAML spec (local file or URL)
2. **AggregateResolver** - Identifies aggregates from tags (`{context}.{aggregate}` pattern), extracts commands, state, events, fields
3. **ModelGenerator** - Generates TypeScript types/enums from schemas (skips `wow.*` schemas except `wow.api.query.*PagedList` and `wow.api.query.Operator*Map`; the exact base `wow.api.query.PagedList` is skipped too, and aggregate-specific `*PagedList` schemas map to `PagedList` from `@ahoo-wang/fetcher-wow`)
4. **ClientGenerator** - Generates QueryClient, CommandClient, StreamCommandClient, ApiClient per aggregate
5. **Index Generator** - Creates `index.ts` barrel exports at every directory level
6. **Post-processing** - `formatText()`, `organizeImports()`, `fixMissingImports()` on all files

Generated object properties follow each schema's `required` list, including nested
objects and `allOf` siblings. Read-only properties retain `readonly` in nullable
and inline object aliases. Required keys absent from `properties` follow
`additionalProperties`, remain open to extra keys when that option is omitted,
and preserve custom `x-map-key-schema` constraints. Forbidden required keys have
type `never`; required names use own-property checks and escaped property names.
For undeclared required keys with default or `true` additional properties, the
fallback accepts primitive/null values, dictionaries, and readonly arrays while
rejecting function values, so inherited prototype methods do not satisfy them.
TypeScript cannot prove arbitrary properties are own properties or recursively
validate JSON values through these structural types.
OpenAPI 3.0 `nullable: true` permits `null` only when enum, const, and composition
constraints also allow it. A standalone `required` list only constrains objects.
Without `type`, nonempty `properties` still constrain object instances, including
beside compositions; these object branches remain open when
`additionalProperties` is omitted. The unconstrained non-object branch includes
mutable and readonly arrays.
Object constraints in `allOf`, including nested compositions and references,
exclude primitive and array branches. Object-constrained compositions and nonempty
enum/const object literals, including nested literals, also add an
optional `globalThis.Symbol.iterator` property of type `never`, so readonly arrays
cannot satisfy a weak object shape. This boundary requires `ES2015.Iterable` or a
higher standard library, such as the repository's ES2020 library. Custom iterable
objects must first be converted to plain JSON objects; this is not a general
TypeScript representation of every JavaScript object that is not an array.
Mixed `oneOf` and `anyOf` branches retain their allowed non-object values.
Empty root properties do not erase composition constraints. When multiple
composition keywords occur together, each `allOf` intersection and `oneOf` or
`anyOf` union is retained, then their results are intersected. A `type` array
applies the same schema constraints to each listed type before forming its union,
so object/array alternatives do not introduce an unconstrained `any`. Repeated
composition nodes and edges are collected once, then object constraints propagate
until stable. Recursive references do not produce path-dependent partial cache
entries, and repeated DAG branches reuse the same collected nodes. A component named
`Exclude` remains usable alongside composed object schemas. Generated `Record`
references use `globalThis.Record` so a component named `Record` cannot shadow
the utility type.

All `allOf` schemas generate TypeScript intersection aliases so required,
optional, and conflicting property types retain every member constraint. Object
schemas with optional properties and schema-valued `additionalProperties` also
use an intersection alias: the declared properties retain their modifiers while
the string index keeps the additional-property type without adding `undefined`.
Other plain object schemas continue generating interfaces. TypeScript string
indexes also constrain declared keys; they cannot express the JSON Schema case
where declared properties have types incompatible with `additionalProperties`.
Generated types do not perform runtime JSON validation.

String-only enums with no const or composition constraints, and with `type` omitted or set to `'string'`, remain TypeScript enums (including empty-string members).
Separator-only values whose normalized name is empty retain their original key,
so `Model['']` and `Model['-']` are distinct; the same keys apply to `EnumText` and
composed enum value objects. When a string enum also has `allOf`, `oneOf`, or `anyOf`, it generates a constrained type
alias and a same-name `const` object, preserving runtime access such as
`Model.ON`. The object retains every declared enum value; the type alias rejects
values excluded by the composition. Use `typeof Model.ON` for a member's type in
this form. `ModelEnumText` remains available when `x-enum-text` is supplied.
Numeric and mixed enums use literal unions that preserve the JSON value types and keep `ModelEnumText` when supplied. Mixed enums also export a same-name `const` object for their existing string members. Enum and const literals are intersected with supported type, object, and composition constraints; contradictory literal and type constraints reject every value. Known literals are checked against JSON type categories, so arrays do not satisfy `object` and fractional numbers do not satisfy `integer`. Empty object literals, including nested enum/const objects, use `globalThis.Record<string, never>` rather than the broad TypeScript `{}` type.

## Generated Output Structure

```

Model files use `types.ts` named by schema path prefix (e.g., schema key `ai.AiMessage.Assistant` maps to `ai/types.ts` with type `AiMessageAssistant`).

## Configuration (fetcher-generator.config.json)

```json
{
  "apiClients": {
    "TagName": {
      "ignorePathParameters": ["tenantId", "ownerId"]
    }
  }
}
```

- `apiClients` - Map of tag name to API client configuration
- `ignorePathParameters` - Path parameters to exclude from generated **API client** methods (default: `['tenantId', 'ownerId']`). Command clients always ignore `tenantId`/`ownerId` regardless of this setting.

## Wow CQRS Pattern Support

### Aggregate Identification

Aggregates are discovered **only from the root `tags:` array** — tags appearing solely on operations are ignored. Tags following `{contextAlias}.{aggregateName}` pattern identify aggregates (e.g., `example.cart`).

An aggregate is emitted only when **both** a state snapshot and a fields definition resolve for it; otherwise the tag falls through to plain API client generation.

### Operation Patterns

- **Commands**: Operation IDs matching `{context}.{aggregate}.{command}` with a request body and an OK response `$ref: #/components/responses/wow.CommandOk` ("OK" means strictly `responses['200']`; the operation `wow.command.send` is skipped)
- **State Snapshots**: Operation IDs ending with `.snapshot_state.single`
- **Events**: Operation IDs ending with `.event.list_query`
- **Fields**: Operation IDs ending with `.snapshot.count`

### API Client Tag Exclusion

Tags named `wow`, `Actuator`, or matching aggregate names are excluded from API client generation.

### Command Clients

```typescript
// Regular command client
export class CartCommandClient<
  R = CommandResult,
> implements ApiMetadataCapable {
  constructor(
    public readonly apiMetadata: ApiMetadata = DEFAULT_COMMAND_CLIENT_OPTIONS,
  ) {}
  @put(CartCommandEndpointPaths.ADD_CART_ITEM)
  addCartItem(
    @request() commandRequest: CommandRequest<AddCartItemCommand>,
    @attribute() attributes?: Record<string, any>,
  ): Promise<R> {
    throw autoGeneratedError(commandRequest, attributes);
  }
}
// Stream variant (extends CommandClient<CommandResultEventStream>)
export class CartStreamCommandClient extends CartCommandClient<CommandResultEventStream> {}
```

Command types use `CommandBody<T>` wrapper. `CommandEndpointPaths` enum maps command names to paths.

### Query Clients

```typescript
export const cartQueryClientFactory = new QueryClientFactory<
  CartState,
  CartAggregatedFields | string,
  CartDomainEventType
>({
  contextAlias: EXAMPLE_BOUNDED_CONTEXT_ALIAS,
  aggregateName: 'cart',
  resourceAttribution: ResourceAttributionPathSpec.OWNER,
});
```

When an aggregate has no `.event.list_query` operation, its generated `DomainEventType` is `never`.

Resource attribution inferred from command paths: `ResourceAttributionPathSpec.OWNER` (`/owner/{ownerId}`), `ResourceAttributionPathSpec.TENANT` (`/tenant/{tenantId}`), or `NONE`.

### API Clients

Generated for non-CQRS endpoints. Parameters `tenantId`/`ownerId` are ignored by default.

## Integration with Fetcher

```typescript
import { Fetcher } from '@ahoo-wang/fetcher';
import { cartQueryClientFactory } from './generated/example/cart/queryClient';
import { CartCommandClient } from './generated/example/cart/commandClient';

const fetcher = new Fetcher({ baseURL: 'https://api.example.com' });
const snapshotClient = cartQueryClientFactory.createSnapshotQueryClient({
  fetcher,
});
const commandClient = new CartCommandClient();
```
